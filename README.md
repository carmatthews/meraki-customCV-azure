# Custom Computer Vision on Azure for Meraki MV Camera

Capture images, prepare a labeled dataset, train a custom object detection model and deploy to Meraki MV camera using Azure Machine Learning and Python.  Analyze data from the device and the object model by streaming to the cloud using Azure IoT Hub, Azure Data Explorer, and PowerBI visualizations.

Steps:

1. Capture images using the Meraki MV Camera.
2. Use the Azure Machine Learning labeling project to prepare the data.
3. Train an object detection model using Azure Machine Learning Notebooks.
4. Deploy the model to the Meraki MV Camera.
5. Setup Streaming to Azure
6. Analyze.
